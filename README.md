# Unit 4 - Personal Narrative

## Introduction

Images are often used to portray our personal experiences and interests. We also use image filters and effects to change or enhance the mood of an image. When combined into collages and presentations, these images tell a story about who we are and what is important to us. Your goal is to create a personal narrative using The Theater that consists of images of your personal experiences and/or interests, incorporates data related to these experiences and/or interests that can be organized in a 2D array, and uses image filters and effects to change or enhance the mood of your images.

## Story Description

This animation showcases aspects of my culture through images and randomly applied filters. The title screen introduces the theme, followed by images representing cultural food and national symbols. Each image is displayed with a randomly chosen filter to add variety and uniqueness to the visuals. The animation uses 2D arrays to organize data: one array (variable1) stores the title text, while another (variable2) holds the images. The filters are applied dynamically based on random selection, making each animation run slightly different while still maintaining the core message of cultural representation.

## Image Filter Analysis

The pixelate filter reduces image detail by dividing it into small blocks and setting each block to the average color of its pixels, creating a mosaic-like effect. The colorize filter changes pixel colors based on brightness—dark areas turn red, medium areas turn green, and bright areas turn blue, giving the image a false-color effect. The Black and White (BW) filter, which I created, converts the image to pure black or white by averaging the pixel’s color and setting it to black if it’s below a certain brightness threshold or white if it’s above. This creates a high-contrast effect that removes all shades of gray. These filters modify the pixels in different ways to enhance the animation’s visuals.
