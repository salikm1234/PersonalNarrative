# Unit 4 - Personal Narrative

## Introduction

Images are often used to portray our personal experiences and interests. We also use image filters and effects to change or enhance the mood of an image. When combined into collages and presentations, these images tell a story about who we are and what is important to us. Your goal is to create a personal narrative using The Theater that consists of images of your personal experiences and/or interests, incorporates data related to these experiences and/or interests that can be organized in a 2D array, and uses image filters and effects to change or enhance the mood of your images.

## Story Description

This animation showcases aspects of my culture through images and randomly applied filters. The title screen introduces the theme, followed by images representing cultural food and national symbols. Each image is displayed with a randomly chosen filter to add variety and uniqueness to the visuals. The animation uses 2D arrays to organize data: one array (variable1) stores the title text, while another (variable2) holds the images. The filters are applied dynamically based on random selection, making each animation run slightly different while still maintaining the core message of cultural representation.

## Image Filter Analysis

The pixelate filter simplifies the image by dividing it into small blocks and replacing each block with the average color of the pixels within it. This reduces detail, creating a mosaic effect. The colorize filter changes the color of each pixel based on brightness—darker areas turn red, medium areas turn green, and bright areas turn blue, giving the image a false-color effect. The blur filter, which I created, smooths the image by averaging the colors of neighboring pixels, making edges less sharp. These filters modify the pixels in different ways to create unique visual effects in the animation.
